# 🎾 Australian Open 120-Year Performance Visualization

> Tableau-based data visualization project analyzing 120 years of Australian Open performance data.  
> Focused on uncovering long-term trends and player-country performance insights.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project visualizes historical Australian Open tennis data (1905–Present), analyzing national, gender, and player-level performance using Tableau dashboards.  
The goal is to identify performance trends, emerging countries, and player dominance patterns over time.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Project Role & Contribution

This is an **independent project** completed by **Chaeeun Lee** as part of a university-level visual analytics report.  
All aspects—data cleaning, transformation, visualization, insight generation, and storytelling—were solely led and developed by the author.

## 🎯 Business Questions

- How has national dominance shifted over 120 years of the Australian Open?
- What are the differences in performance between male and female players?
- Which players have demonstrated historical dominance and consistency?

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Official Australian Open records (pre-processed dataset)
- **Time Period:** 1905 – Present
- **Features:**
  - Player Name, Country, Gender
  - Number of Wins, Matches Played, Win Rates
  - Titles Won, Runner-up Count, Tournament Participation Years

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Preprocessing steps were completed in **Excel** to ensure data compatibility with Tableau and consistency in visual analytics. Tasks included:

- Handling missing values (e.g., seeds, match times) using placeholders like `Not Available` or `0`
- Standardizing player names, country codes, and tournament year formats
- Creating derived features (e.g., win rates, stage-wise results) to enable complex visualizations like parallel coordinates
- Classifying top performers (≥ 5 titles) and segmenting data by gender for deeper comparative analysis
